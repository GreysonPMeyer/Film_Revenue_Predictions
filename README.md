# Film Revenue Prediction

This is a personal data science project to predict the U.S. or global box office revenue of upcoming or recently released films based on metadata available from The Movie Database (TMDB) API.

## Project Goals

- Use film metadata (e.g., genre, director, cast, budget) to predict box office performance.
- Explore data visualization and modeling techniques.
- Practice using external APIs and feature engineering.
- Present findings with explanatory tools like SHAP.

## Data Source

Metadata is pulled from [The Movie Database (TMDB)](https://www.themoviedb.org/) using their public API for non-commercial, educational purposes.

## Status

Project in progress. More updates coming soon!
